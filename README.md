# CSCB09-A1-Image-Processing-in-C

As an assignment in the course CSCB09 at the University of Toronto, I wrote two files in C which when executed, allowed an individual to either remove all red from a PPM image, make a black and white version of a PPM image, or crop a PPM image to a square by default, all of which from the command prompt.
